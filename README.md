## 👉  Features 💯

### NFT-based Ownership
- For every game purchased on Owl, users receive a unique Non-Fungible Token (NFT) associated with that specific game.
- Each game has its own distinct NFT, providing a secure and verifiable proof of ownership.

### License Key Integration
- With the NFT received upon purchase, users also gain access to the corresponding license key for the game.
- This license key is utilized to activate the purchased game, ensuring a seamless and controlled access process.

### Blockchain Integration
- Owl utilizes blockchain technology, specifically the Ethereum network, to push proof of transactions onto the blockchain.
- This enhances transparency and security.
- It guarantees that users never lose ownership of their purchased games.

### Resell Option with Reusable Licenses
- A unique feature of Owl is the ability to resell games that users have already bought.
- The platform supports reusable licenses, allowing users to resell their games to others.
- However, the number of resell transactions is limited, striking a balance between user flexibility and maintaining the integrity of the gaming ecosystem.

## 👉 Problems We Are Solving 🧐

### Piracy and Security
- By leveraging blockchain technology and NFTs, Owl significantly mitigates piracy concerns and enhances security.
- Each game's ownership is securely recorded on the blockchain, reducing the risk of unauthorized distribution.

### Centralization
- Owl eliminates the centralization inherent in traditional gaming platforms.
- The decentralized nature of blockchain ensures that no single entity has absolute control, providing a more democratic and user-centric gaming experience.

### Non-fractional Ownership (Single Entity Ownership)
- Traditional game ownership models often involve centralized control by a single entity.
- Owl's NFT-based ownership ensures non-fractional ownership, empowering users with true ownership of their games without intermediaries.

### Non-transferable Licenses
- Owl addresses the issue of non-transferable licenses common in traditional gaming platforms.
- Through the use of blockchain and NFTs, licenses become transferable, enabling users to resell their games securely within the platform.
